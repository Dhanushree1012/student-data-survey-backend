# Database schema

The application uses the existing Supabase PostgreSQL database. The source of truth is the ordered migration chain in `supabase/migrations/`; generated browser types are maintained in `src/lib/database.types.ts`.

## Tables

| Table | Purpose and key relationships |
|---|---|
| `organizations` | Tenant root for organizational records. |
| `profiles` | One application profile per `auth.users` account; carries organization, role, and optional district. |
| `districts` | Belongs to one organization; organization/code and organization/id are unique. |
| `taluks` | Belongs to an organization and district. |
| `schools` | Belongs to an organization, district, and taluk; composite foreign keys enforce that scope. |
| `screening_sessions` | Belongs to an organization, district, taluk, and school; created by a profile in the same organization. |
| `session_assignments` | Connects an enumerator profile with a session in the same organization; duplicate session/enumerator pairs are prohibited. |
| `student_screenings` | Student screening data connected to one complete session/location tuple and its creator. |
| `audit_logs` | Trigger-generated records for audited data changes, with organization and optional district scope. |
| `user_invitations` | Invitation history and state for the role/scope approved at creation; Auth-user identity is linked after the Admin Auth invite call. |

The legacy `students` table is not part of migrations 001–007 and is intentionally not exposed in generated application types.

## Integrity and lifecycle

- Composite foreign keys enforce organization/district/taluk/school consistency rather than trusting browser-supplied IDs.
- `profiles.id` references `auth.users.id`; deleting an Auth user cascades to its profile.
- Invitation organization, district, and inviter references use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to retain invitation history. Deleting the linked Auth user clears `auth_user_id` but does not erase the invitation.
- Invitation identity/scope fields are immutable. Invitation creation uses an inviter-bound idempotency key and a global active-email uniqueness index.
- Profile creation happens only in `accept_user_invitation`, after the confirmed Auth user matches both the invitation email and recorded `auth_user_id`. Profile creation and the accepted state update happen in one database transaction.
- Cancellation does not revoke a Supabase Auth email link. The acceptance function rejects a cancelled invitation, and Auth users are not automatically deleted.
- Resend, automatic expiry, and operator reconciliation are intentionally not implemented.

## Migration order

1. `001_init.sql` — tenant, profile, district, and initial screening tables.
2. `002_live_backend.sql` — locations, sessions, assignments, screening schema, helper functions, RLS, and audit triggers.
3. `003_district_manager_scope.sql` — district-scoped reads and assignments.
4. `004_audit_and_delete_scope.sql` — district-aware audit visibility and safe assignment deletion rules.
5. `005_user_invitations.sql` — invitation storage, policies, and guarded database operations.
6. `006_restrict_profile_updates.sql` — removes browser table-wide profile updates and grants only the display-name column, preventing role and tenant-scope escalation.
7. `007_scope_enumerator_locations.sql` — limits enumerator location reads to their own district and locations used by sessions assigned to them.

The local development database was verified with migrations 001–007 applied. Hosted migration state is unknown and must be checked by an authorized owner before any hosted rollout. Never reset a database to resolve migration history.

## Local database tests

Run the pgTAP suite against the local Supabase stack:

```powershell
npx supabase test db .\supabase\tests\database
```

The tests run inside transactions and roll back their fixtures. Concurrency guarantees should additionally be exercised with separate local database sessions; the single-session pgTAP tests do not establish race behavior.
